# basu

The sd-bus library, extracted from systemd.

> **Heads up!** This project has migrated to SourceHut: https://sr.ht/~emersion/basu/

Some projects rely on the sd-bus library for DBus support. However not all
systems have systemd or elogind installed. This library provides just sd-bus
(and the `busctl` utility).
